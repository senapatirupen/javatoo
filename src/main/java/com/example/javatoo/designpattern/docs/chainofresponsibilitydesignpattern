Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
--------------------------------------
Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Then the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be pricessing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.

We know that we can have multiple catch blocks in a try-catch block code. Here every catch block is kind of a processor to process that particular exception.

So when any exception occurs in the try block, its send to the first catch block to process. If the catch block is not able to process it, it forwards the request to next object in chain i.e next catch block. If even the last catch block is not able to process it, the exception is thrown outside of the chain to the calling program.

ATM Dispense machine
The user enters the amount to be despensed and the machine dispense amount in terms of defiend currency bills such as 50$, 20$, 10$ etc.
If the users enters an amount that is not multiples of 10, it throws error. We will use chain of responsibility pattern to implement this solution.

Note that we can implement this solution easily in a program itself but then the complexity will increase and the solution will be tightly coupled. So we will create a chain of dispense systems to dispense bills of 50$, 20$ and 10$.

public class Currency{
	private int ammount;
	public Currency(int amt){
		this.amount = amt;
	}
	public int getAmount(){
		return this.amount;
	}
}

the base interface should have a method to define the next processor in the chain and the method that will process the request.

public interface DispenseChain{
	void setNextChain(DispenseChain nextChain);
	void dispense(Currency cur);
}

chain implementations

public class Dollar50Dispenser implements DispenseChain{
	private DispenseChain chain;	
	
	@Override
	public void setNextChain(DispenseChain nextChain){
		this.chain = nextChain;
	}
	
	@Override
	public void dispense(Currency cur){
		if(cur.getAmount() >= 50){
			int num = cur.getAmount()/50;
			int remainder = cur.getAmount() % 50;
			System.out.println("Dispensing "+num+" 50$ note");
			if(remainder !=0)
				this.chain.dispense(new Currency(remainder));
		} else {
			this.chain.dispense(cur);
		}
	}
}

public class Dollar20Dispenser implements DispenseChain{
	private DispenseChain chain;	
	
	@Override
	public void setNextChain(DispenseChain nextChain){
		this.chain = nextChain;
	}
	
	@Override
	public void dispense(Currency cur){
		if(cur.getAmount() >= 20){
			int num = cur.getAmount()/20;
			int remainder = cur.getAmount() % 20;
			System.out.println("Dispensing "+num+" 20$ note");
			if(remainder !=0)
				this.chain.dispense(new Currency(remainder));
		} else {
			this.chain.dispense(cur);
		}
	}
}

public class Dollar10Dispenser implements DispenseChain{
	private DispenseChain chain;	
	
	@Override
	public void setNextChain(DispenseChain nextChain){
		this.chain = nextChain;
	}
	
	@Override
	public void dispense(Currency cur){
		if(cur.getAmount() >= 10){
			int num = cur.getAmount()/10;
			int remainder = cur.getAmount() % 10;
			System.out.println("Dispensing "+num+" 10$ note");
			if(remainder !=0)
				this.chain.dispense(new Currency(remainder));
		} else {
			this.chain.dispense(cur);
		}
	}
}

public class ATMDispenseChain {
	private DispenseChain c1;
	public ATMDispenseChain(){
		//initialize the chain
		this.c1 = new Dollar50Dispenser();
		DispenseChain c2 = new Dollar20Dispenser();
		DispenseChain c3 = new Dollar10Dispenser();
		
		//set the chain of responsibility
		c1.setNextChain(c2);
		c2.setNextChain(c3);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		ATMDispenseChain atmDispenser = new ATMDispenseChain();
		while(true){
			int amount = 0;
			System.out.println("Enter amount to dispense");
			Scanner input = Scanner(System.in);
			amount = input.nextInt();
			if(amount % 10 !=0){
				System.out.println("Amount should be in multiple of 10s.");
				return;
			}
			//process the request
			atmDispenser.c1.dispense(new Currency(amount));
			}
		}
	}
}

Ponts to remember
> Client doesn't know which part of the chain will be processing the request and it will send the request to the first object in the chain. For example, in our program ATMDispenseChain is unware of who is processing the request to dispense the entered amount.
> Each object in the chain will its own implementation to process the request, either full or partial or to send it to the next object in the chain.
> Every object in the chain should have reference to the next object in chain to forward the request to, its achieved by java composition.
> Creating the chain carefully is very important otherwise there might be a case that the request will never be forwarded to a particular processor or there are no objects in the chain who are able to handle the request. In my implementation, I have added the check for the user entered amount to make sure it gets processed fully by all the processors but we might not check it and thorw exception if the request reaches the last object and there are no further objects in the chain to forward the request to. This is a design decision.
> Chain of Responsibility design pattern is good to achieve lose coupling but it comes with the trade-off of having a lot of implementation classes and maintenance problems if most of the code is common in all the implementations.

Example:
java.util.logging.Logger#log()
javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()
