Christopher Alexander was the first person who invented all the above Design Patterns in 1977.
But later the Gang of Four - Design patterns, elements of reusable object-oriented software book was written by a group of four persons named as Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides in 1995.
