/*
The TIMED_WAITING state
A thread, t1, that waits for an explicit period of time for another thread, t2, to finish is in the TIMED_WAITING state.
This scenario is shaped in the following snippet of code:
1.Create a thread: t1.
2.Start t1 via the start() method.
3.In the run() method of t1, add a sleep time of two seconds (arbitrary time).
4.While t1 is running, the main thread prints the t1 stateâ€”the state should be TIMED_WAITING since t1 is in a sleep() that will expire after two seconds.
