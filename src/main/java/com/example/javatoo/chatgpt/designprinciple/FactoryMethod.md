Certainly! The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. Here's an example of implementing the Factory Method pattern in Java:

First, let's define the abstract product interface:

```java
interface Product {
    void doSomething();
}
```

Next, let's create concrete product implementations:

```java
class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something in ConcreteProductA.");
    }
}

class ConcreteProductB implements Product {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something in ConcreteProductB.");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have two concrete product classes: `ConcreteProductA` and `ConcreteProductB`. Each product class provides its own implementation of the `doSomething()` method.

Next, let's define the abstract factory class with the factory method:

```java
abstract class Factory {
    abstract Product createProduct();

    void doSomethingWithProduct() {
        Product product = createProduct();
        product.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an abstract factory class `Factory` that declares the factory method `createProduct()`. It also provides a common method `doSomethingWithProduct()` that utilizes the factory method to create a product instance and perform some operation on it.

Next, let's create concrete factory implementations:

```java
class ConcreteFactoryA extends Factory {
    Product createProduct() {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

class ConcreteFactoryB extends Factory {
    Product createProduct() {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have two concrete factory classes: `ConcreteFactoryA` and `ConcreteFactoryB`. Each factory class overrides the `createProduct()` method and returns the corresponding concrete product instance.

Finally, let's see how we can use the Factory Method pattern:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Factory factoryA = new ConcreteFactoryA();
        Factory factoryB = new ConcreteFactoryB();

        factoryA.doSomethingWithProduct();
        factoryB.doSomethingWithProduct();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create instances of `ConcreteFactoryA` and `ConcreteFactoryB`. We then call the `doSomethingWithProduct()` method on each factory instance, which internally uses the factory method to create a product instance and perform some operation on it.

When we run the program, it will output:

```
Doing something in ConcreteProductA.
Doing something in ConcreteProductB.
```

The Factory Method pattern allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate by providing an abstract factory method. It promotes loose coupling and extensibility, as new subclasses can be created to produce different product instances. This pattern is useful when you want to delegate the responsibility of creating objects to subclasses or when you need to provide a customizable way of creating objects.
