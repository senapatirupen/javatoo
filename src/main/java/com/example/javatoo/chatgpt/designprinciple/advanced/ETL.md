The Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) architecture pattern is a commonly used approach in data integration and data warehousing. It involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a target system such as a data warehouse. Here's an example of implementing the ETL architecture pattern in Java:

First, let's define the classes for the Extract, Transform, and Load components:

```java
class Extractor {
    public void extractData() {
        // Code to extract data from the source system
        System.out.println("Extracting data from the source system...");
    }
}

class Transformer {
    public void transformData() {
        // Code to transform the extracted data
        System.out.println("Transforming data...");
    }
}

class Loader {
    public void loadData() {
        // Code to load the transformed data into the target system
        System.out.println("Loading data into the target system...");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the `Extractor` class responsible for extracting data from the source system, the `Transformer` class responsible for transforming the extracted data, and the `Loader` class responsible for loading the transformed data into the target system.

Next, let's create a class to coordinate the ETL process:

```java
class ETLProcessor {
    private Extractor extractor;
    private Transformer transformer;
    private Loader loader;

    public ETLProcessor() {
        this.extractor = new Extractor();
        this.transformer = new Transformer();
        this.loader = new Loader();
    }

    public void executeETL() {
        extractor.extractData();
        transformer.transformData();
        loader.loadData();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the `ETLProcessor` class that coordinates the ETL process. It has instances of the `Extractor`, `Transformer`, and `Loader` components. The `executeETL()` method calls the appropriate methods of each component in the sequence required for the ETL process.

Finally, let's see how we can use the ETL architecture:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ETLProcessor etlProcessor = new ETLProcessor();
        etlProcessor.executeETL();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `ETLProcessor` class and call the `executeETL()` method to start the ETL process. This will invoke the appropriate methods in the `Extractor`, `Transformer`, and `Loader` components to perform the data extraction, transformation, and loading operations.

The ETL architecture pattern provides a structured approach to extract data from various sources, transform it into a suitable format, and load it into a target system. It enables the integration of heterogeneous data sources and the preparation of data for analysis and reporting purposes. By separating the extraction, transformation, and loading steps, this pattern promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability in data integration processes.
