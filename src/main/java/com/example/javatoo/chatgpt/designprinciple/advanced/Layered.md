The Layered Architecture pattern is a widely used architectural pattern that organizes an application into distinct layers, each with its specific responsibilities. Here's an example of implementing the Layered Architecture pattern in Java:

First, let's define the classes for each layer:

1. Presentation Layer (User Interface):
```java
class PresentationLayer {
    private BusinessLayer businessLayer;

    public PresentationLayer() {
        this.businessLayer = new BusinessLayer();
    }

    public void processUserRequest() {
        System.out.println("Processing user request in the Presentation Layer");
        businessLayer.performBusinessLogic();
    }
}
```

2. Business Layer:
```java
class BusinessLayer {
    private DataAccessLayer dataAccessLayer;

    public BusinessLayer() {
        this.dataAccessLayer = new DataAccessLayer();
    }

    public void performBusinessLogic() {
        System.out.println("Performing business logic in the Business Layer");
        dataAccessLayer.accessData();
    }
}
```

3. Data Access Layer:
```java
class DataAccessLayer {
    public void accessData() {
        System.out.println("Accessing data in the Data Access Layer");
        // Perform data access operations
    }
}
```

In this example, we have three layers: Presentation Layer, Business Layer, and Data Access Layer. The Presentation Layer interacts with the user interface and delegates the business logic to the Business Layer. The Business Layer, in turn, delegates data access operations to the Data Access Layer.

Next, let's create a class to coordinate the layers:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PresentationLayer presentationLayer = new PresentationLayer();
        presentationLayer.processUserRequest();
    }
}
```

In the `Main` class, we create an instance of the Presentation Layer and call the `processUserRequest()` method to initiate the processing of a user request. This will trigger the execution of the respective methods in the Business Layer and Data Access Layer.

The Layered Architecture pattern promotes separation of concerns and modularization of an application by dividing it into cohesive layers. Each layer has a specific responsibility, and communication between layers follows a strict hierarchy. This pattern improves maintainability, scalability, and reusability of the application.

Note that this is a simplified example to illustrate the Layered Architecture pattern. In a real-world scenario, you might have additional classes and interfaces within each layer to handle specific functionality and dependencies.
