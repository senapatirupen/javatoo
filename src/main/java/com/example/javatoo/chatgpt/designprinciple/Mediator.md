Certainly! The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact with each other. Here's an example of implementing the Mediator pattern in Java:

Let's consider a chat application where users can send messages to each other through a central chat room.

First, let's define the mediator interface:

```java
interface ChatMediator {
    void sendMessage(String message, User sender);
    void addUser(User user);
}
```

Next, let's create the concrete mediator class:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    private List<User> users;

    public ChatRoom() {
        users = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void sendMessage(String message, User sender) {
        for (User user : users) {
            if (user != sender) {
                user.receiveMessage(message);
            }
        }
    }

    public void addUser(User user) {
        users.add(user);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the `ChatRoom` class implementing the `ChatMediator` interface. It maintains a list of users and handles sending messages to all users except the sender.

Next, let's create the user class:

```java
class User {
    private String name;
    private ChatMediator chatMediator;

    public User(String name, ChatMediator chatMediator) {
        this.name = name;
        this.chatMediator = chatMediator;
    }

    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        chatMediator.sendMessage(message, this);
    }

    public void receiveMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received message: " + message);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `User` class represents a user of the chat application. Each user has a name and a reference to the chat mediator. Users can send messages by calling the `sendMessage()` method, which delegates the message sending to the chat mediator. Users also have a `receiveMessage()` method to handle receiving messages.

Finally, let's see how we can use the Mediator pattern:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatMediator chatMediator = new ChatRoom();

        User user1 = new User("User 1", chatMediator);
        User user2 = new User("User 2", chatMediator);
        User user3 = new User("User 3", chatMediator);

        chatMediator.addUser(user1);
        chatMediator.addUser(user2);
        chatMediator.addUser(user3);

        user1.sendMessage("Hello, everyone!");
        user2.sendMessage("Hi, User 1!");
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `ChatRoom` object as the mediator. We create three `User` objects and pass the chat mediator to each user. We add the users to the chat mediator using the `addUser()` method. Users can then send messages by calling the `sendMessage()` method.

When we run the program, it will output:

```
User 2 received message: Hello, everyone!
User 3 received message: Hello, everyone!
User 1 received message: Hi, User 1!
User 3 received message: Hi, User 1!
```

The Mediator pattern allows objects to communicate with each other without direct references, promoting loose coupling and simplifying the interaction logic. It enables the centralization of communication logic in a mediator object, resulting in more maintainable and flexible code.
