Certainly! The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It allows for additional functionality to be added while maintaining the same interface as the original object. Here's an example of implementing the Proxy pattern in Java:

First, let's define the subject interface that represents the real object and proxy:

```java
interface Subject {
    void request();
}
```

Next, let's create the real object class:

```java
class RealSubject implements Subject {
    public void request() {
        System.out.println("RealSubject: Handling request.");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the `RealSubject` class that implements the `Subject` interface. It represents the real object that the proxy will control access to.

Next, let's create the proxy class:

```java
class Proxy implements Subject {
    private RealSubject realSubject;

    public void request() {
        if (realSubject == null) {
            realSubject = new RealSubject();
        }

        preRequest();
        realSubject.request();
        postRequest();
    }

    private void preRequest() {
        System.out.println("Proxy: Preparing request.");
    }

    private void postRequest() {
        System.out.println("Proxy: Finishing request.");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the `Proxy` class that also implements the `Subject` interface. It acts as a proxy for the real subject and controls access to it. The proxy maintains a reference to the real subject and delegates the `request()` method call to it. It can perform additional operations before and after invoking the real subject's `request()` method.

Finally, let's see how we can use the Proxy pattern:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Subject proxy = new Proxy();
        proxy.request();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `Proxy` class and assign it to a variable of type `Subject`. We then call the `request()` method on the proxy, which internally invokes the real subject's `request()` method.

When we run the program, it will output:

```
Proxy: Preparing request.
RealSubject: Handling request.
Proxy: Finishing request.
```

The Proxy pattern allows for additional functionality to be added to an object without changing its interface. It can be used to control access to the real object, provide caching, or perform additional operations before or after invoking the real object's methods. This pattern is useful when you want to add an extra layer of indirection to control access to an object or when you need to add functionality to an existing object without modifying its code.
