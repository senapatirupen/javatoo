If you're looking to exclude a specific dependency defined in the parent POM from being inherited by a child module in a Spring Boot application, you can achieve this using the `<dependencyManagement>` section in the child module's POM.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the child module's `pom.xml` file.

2. Inside the `<dependencies>` section of the `pom.xml`, you can exclude the specific dependency that you want to exclude from the parent POM.

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <!-- Dependencies inherited from parent POM -->
       <dependency>
           <!-- ... -->
       </dependency>
   
       <!-- Exclude a specific dependency -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>group-id</groupId>
           <artifactId>artifact-id</artifactId>
           <version>version</version>
           <scope>provided</scope> <!-- Or use a scope that fits your needs -->
       </dependency>
   
       <!-- Other dependencies -->
   </dependencies>
   ```

3. If you want to exclude a transitive dependency that the parent POM includes, you can add an `<exclusions>` section within the `<dependency>` element.

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <!-- Dependencies inherited from parent POM -->
       <dependency>
           <!-- ... -->
       </dependency>
   
       <!-- Exclude a specific transitive dependency -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>group-id</groupId>
           <artifactId>artifact-id</artifactId>
           <version>version</version>
           <exclusions>
               <exclusion>
                   <groupId>excluded-group-id</groupId>
                   <artifactId>excluded-artifact-id</artifactId>
               </exclusion>
           </exclusions>
       </dependency>
   
       <!-- Other dependencies -->
   </dependencies>
   ```

4. Make sure to replace `group-id`, `artifact-id`, `version`, `excluded-group-id`, and `excluded-artifact-id` with the actual values of the dependencies.

By specifying the `<dependency>` element with the appropriate `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` in the child module's `pom.xml`, you can override or exclude the inherited dependency from the parent POM. This gives you control over the dependencies in your child module independently from the parent module.

After making these changes, remember to rebuild your project or refresh your IDE so that the changes take effect.

Always ensure that you understand the implications of excluding dependencies, as they might be required for the proper functioning of your application.
