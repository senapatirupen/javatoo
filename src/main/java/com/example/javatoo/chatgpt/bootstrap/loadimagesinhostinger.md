To load Angular images in Hostinger, you can follow these steps:

1. Place your image files: In your Angular project, ensure that your image files are located in a directory within the `src/assets` folder. For example, you can create an `images` directory inside `src/assets` and place your images there.

2. Build your Angular app: Run the following command in your Angular project directory to build your app:
```
ng build --prod
```
This command will generate a production-ready build of your Angular app in the `dist` directory.

3. Upload the built files: Using an FTP client or the file manager in your Hostinger control panel (cPanel), upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your Hostinger server. Make sure to upload the entire contents, including the `assets` folder.

4. Reference the images in your Angular code: In your Angular templates or components, use the relative path to reference the images. For example, if your image file is located at `assets/images/my-image.jpg`, you can use the following code to display the image:
```html
<img src="assets/images/my-image.jpg" alt="My Image">
```

5. Verify the image loading: Access your Angular app on Hostinger using the appropriate URL. Make sure the images are loading correctly. You can inspect the page using your browser's developer tools to check for any errors in the image URLs.

Ensure that the image paths in your Angular code match the directory structure and filenames of your uploaded image files on Hostinger. Double-check the file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png) and letter case, as they are case-sensitive on some server configurations.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully load and display images in your Angular app deployed on Hostinger.
