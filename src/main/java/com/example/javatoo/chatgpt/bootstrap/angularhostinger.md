Hostinger is a popular web hosting provider that offers various hosting plans, including shared hosting, cloud hosting, and VPS hosting. You can deploy an Angular application on Hostinger by following these general steps:

1. Build your Angular Application:
    - Use the Angular CLI to build your Angular application for production. Run the following command in your project directory:
      ```
      ng build --prod
      ```
    - This will generate a `dist` folder containing the compiled and optimized version of your Angular application.

2. Upload your Angular Application to Hostinger:
    - Connect to your Hostinger hosting account using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or SFTP (Secure FTP).
    - Navigate to the appropriate directory where you want to upload your Angular application files.
    - Upload the contents of the `dist` folder (generated in the previous step) to the desired location on your Hostinger server.

3. Configure Server-Side Routing:
    - By default, Angular applications use client-side routing, which requires some additional server-side configuration to handle URL routing correctly.
    - For Hostinger's shared hosting, you may need to create an `.htaccess` file (if it doesn't exist) in the root directory of your Angular application and configure it to redirect all requests to the `index.html` file. This ensures that Angular's routing works properly.
    - Here's an example of an `.htaccess` file that performs the necessary redirect:
      ```
      Options -MultiViews
      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
      RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
      ```

4. Test your Angular Application:
    - Once the deployment is complete, you can access your Angular application by entering the domain or URL associated with your Hostinger hosting account.
    - Ensure that your application loads correctly and all the functionality is working as expected.

Please note that the exact steps and configurations may vary depending on the specific hosting plan and configuration you have with Hostinger. It's always recommended to refer to Hostinger's documentation or consult their support team for specific instructions related to deploying Angular applications on their hosting platform.
