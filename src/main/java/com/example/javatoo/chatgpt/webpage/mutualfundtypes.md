There are several types of mutual funds available to investors, each with its own investment objectives, risk profiles, and strategies. Here are some common types of mutual funds:

1. Equity Funds: Also known as stock funds, equity funds invest primarily in stocks of publicly traded companies. These funds aim for capital appreciation by selecting stocks based on various criteria, such as market capitalization (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap), geographic region, sector, or investment style (value, growth, blend).

2. Bond Funds: Bond funds invest in fixed-income securities such as government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, or a combination thereof. They aim to generate income for investors through regular interest payments while also seeking capital preservation. Bond funds may vary in terms of the credit quality, duration, and type of bonds they hold.

3. Money Market Funds: Money market funds invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments such as Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. These funds aim to provide stability and liquidity, making them suitable for investors seeking a safe place to park cash or earn a modest return with minimal risk.

4. Balanced Funds: Balanced funds, also known as hybrid funds, invest in a mix of stocks and bonds. These funds seek a balance between income and capital appreciation by diversifying across different asset classes. The allocation between stocks and bonds can vary based on the fund's investment strategy and objectives.

5. Index Funds: Index funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500 or the FTSE 100. These funds passively invest in the same securities that make up the target index, aiming to closely track its returns. Index funds generally have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds.

6. Sector Funds: Sector funds focus on specific sectors of the economy, such as technology, healthcare, energy, or financial services. These funds concentrate their investments in companies operating within a particular industry or sector, offering investors targeted exposure to specific areas of the market.

7. International/Global Funds: International or global funds invest in securities from foreign markets. International funds focus on specific regions or countries, while global funds have a broader mandate to invest across multiple countries. These funds provide investors with exposure to international markets and diversification beyond domestic investments.

8. Real Estate Funds: Real estate funds invest in real estate-related assets, such as commercial properties, residential properties, real estate investment trusts (REITs), or mortgage-backed securities. These funds offer exposure to the real estate sector and the potential for income and capital appreciation.

It's important to note that the above list represents some common types of mutual funds, and there may be additional specialized or niche funds available in the market. Investors should carefully consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when selecting mutual funds and consult with a financial advisor if needed.
