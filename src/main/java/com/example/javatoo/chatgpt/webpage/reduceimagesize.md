To reduce the image size for an HTML page, you can try the following techniques:

1. Image Compression: Use image compression techniques to reduce the file size without significantly affecting the image quality. There are various online tools and desktop applications available for compressing images. Some popular tools include TinyPNG, ImageOptim, and Squoosh.

2. Resize Images: If the dimensions of the image are larger than required, resize the image to fit the desired dimensions. This reduces the file size as well as the rendering time. You can use image editing software like Adobe Photoshop or online image resizing tools for this purpose.

3. Image Format Selection: Choose the appropriate image format based on the type of image and the desired level of compression. For photographs or images with a wide range of colors, use JPEG format. For images with limited colors or transparent backgrounds, consider using PNG format. For simple icons or illustrations, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format can be used, which provides smaller file sizes.

4. Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images, especially for images that are not initially visible on the screen. Lazy loading defers the loading of off-screen images until they are about to come into view, reducing the initial load time of the page.

5. Use CSS Sprites: CSS sprites combine multiple images into a single image file and then use CSS background positioning to display the specific image. This reduces the number of HTTP requests required to load multiple images, resulting in faster page load times.

6. Content Delivery Network (CDN): Consider using a CDN to host your images. CDNs can optimize image delivery by serving them from edge servers located closer to the user, reducing latency and improving loading speed.

7. HTML Picture Element and Srcset Attribute: Utilize the HTML `<picture>` element and the `srcset` attribute to serve different-sized images based on the device's screen size. This ensures that the appropriate image size is delivered to different devices, reducing unnecessary data transfer.

By implementing these techniques, you can significantly reduce the image size for your HTML page, improving the overall performance and loading time of your website.
