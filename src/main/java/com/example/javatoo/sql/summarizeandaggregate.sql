--Using Aggregate Results in Other Queries
--Problem
--You want to use the output of a complex query involving aggregates and grouping as source data for
--another query.

--Counting Members in Groups and Sets
--Problem
--You need to count members of a group, groups of groups, and other set-based collections. You also need
--to include and exclude individual members and groups dynamically based on other data at the same
--time. For instance, you want to count how many jobs each employee has held during their time at the
--organization, based on the number of promotions theyâ€™ve had within the company.
